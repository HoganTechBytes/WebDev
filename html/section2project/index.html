<h2>Some of my favorite movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Beautiful anime from acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.</p>
<p>
  The fanciful adventures of a ten-year-old girl named Chihiro, who discovers a
  secret world when she and her family get lost and venture through a hillside
  tunnel. When her parents undergo a mysterious transformation, Chihiro must
  fend for herself as she encounters strange spirits, assorted creatures and a
  grumpy sorceress who seeks to prevent her from returning to the human world.

<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>
  A cult classic modern fairy tail from director Rob Reiner.<br />
  Staring:

    <li>Robin Wright</li>
    <li>Mandy Patinkin</li>
    <li>André "the Giant" Roussimoff</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  In this enchantingly cracked fairy tale, the beautiful Princess Buttercup and
  the dashing Westley must overcome staggering odds to find happiness amid
  six-fingered swordsmen, murderous princes, Sicilians and rodents of unusual
  size. But even death can't stop these true lovebirds from triumphing.

<h3>Hook</h3>
<p>
  Fantastic telling of when Peter Pan grew up. From director Steven Spielberg.<br />

<p>
  The boy who wasn't supposed to grow up—Peter Pan—does just that, becoming a
  soulless corporate lawyer whose workaholism could cost him his wife and kids.
  During his trip to see Granny Wendy in London, the vengeful Capt. Hook kidnaps
  Peter's kids and forces Peter to return to Neverland.
